# Models & EntityGetter

Models wrap normalized DTOs and provide computed logic.

---

## Model Responsibilities

Models:

- expose fields
- provide computed values
- resolve relations lazily

Models do NOT:

- own data
- fetch data
- manage lifecycle

---

## Constructor Signature

```ts
export class PostModel {
  id: string;
  viewerId: string;
  title: string;

  constructor(
    dto: PostDto,
    private readonly get: EntityGetter,
  ) {
    this.id = dto.id;
    this.viewerId = dto.viewerId;
    this.title = dto.title;

    makeAutoObservable(this, {}, { autoBind: true });
  }

  get viewer() {
    return this.get(ENTITY_KEY.VIEWER, this.viewerId);
  }
}
```

---

## EntityGetter

EntityGetter resolves entities from EntitiesStore without strong references.

```ts
get(ENTITY_KEY.VIEWER, viewerId);
```

---

## Relations Example

```ts
get viewer() {
  return this.get(ENTITY_KEY.VIEWER, this.viewerId);
}
```

---

## Why Not Direct References

Direct references cause:

- circular graphs
- memory leaks
- unsafe cleanup

EntityGetter avoids these problems.

---

## Reactivity Guarantees

- relation access is reactive
- MobX tracks reads automatically
- UI updates are precise

---

## Anti-Patterns

❌ Caching resolved relations
❌ Storing model references
❌ Mutating DTOs directly

---

### Mutating DTOs Directly

Entity models must be treated as **read-only views**
over normalized data.

Directly mutating fields originating from DTOs
(e.g. `model.title = ...`) is not allowed.

All entity updates must go through Records or Collections,
ensuring proper normalization, lifecycle tracking
and deterministic cleanup.

---

## Guarantees

- GC-safe relations
- no stale references
- shared entity updates
